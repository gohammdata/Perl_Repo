<h1>Perl General Projects</h1>
<p>This repository is for exploratory purposes for the Perl coding language. A bit harder of a language to learn, but the benefits outweigh the learning curve in my opinion.</p>
<p>Run in UNIX command line using:</p> 
<ol><i>chmod a+x perl_program </i> to compile </ol> 
<ol>call the program by<i>./perl_program.plx</i> to run in command line.</ol>
